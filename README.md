# 🟪 JAMUJAIRU 

`by Francis Studios`

Jamujairu is a file directory readup (like `$ ls` in unix or `> dir` in MS Windows) but better _at least nicer_ this is my preferred way to display a folder. This is a modernized port of a previous program I wrote: jamujairu.js which was powered by NODE JS. 

## 🫴 Usage

You can make a batch or bash file / alias and reference the executable in your environment variables (or .bashrc or smth.)
